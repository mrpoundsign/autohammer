# AutoHammer for [AutoForge](https://playautoforge.com/)

AutoHammer is a mod to make modding for AutoForge easier by creating hooks and systems so core files do not need to be overwritten by any other mod to augment AutoForge.

Currently the functionality is extremely limited. Contributions are welcome.
